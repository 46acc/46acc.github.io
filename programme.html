<h1>Excursion</h1>
<p>Our excursion will be on Wednesday 4 December to <a href="https://lonepinekoalasanctuary.com" target="_blank">Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary</a>. The coach will leave UQ St. Lucia Campus, Chancellors Place at 11:00am and take us directly to Lone Pine. 
  You may wish to bring your own lunch to the excursion, or lunch may be purhcased at one of the two cafes at Lone Pine.  While out on the excursion, we highly recommend that you take the opportunity to feed the kangaroos and attend at least one of the 
  shows on their Daily Schedule. The return journey coach will pick us up from Lone Pine at 5:00pm and return to UQ St. Lucia Campus, Chancellors Place.  </p>
<p><b></b>Tickets for the excursion are optional </b>(not included in your conference registration) and may be purchased at registration (approximately $60 per ticket, with a discounted option for eligible students). </p>
<p>If you have booked an excursion ticket (or tickets) then you will have received an email on 2 December with some further details about the day. </p>
  
<h1>Conference Dinner</h1>
<p>Our conference dinner will be held on Thursday 5 December at <a href="https://transhotel.net.au/" target="_blank"> The Transcontinental Hotel</a> 482 George Street, Brisbane City, from 6-11pm on the upstairs level. When registering for the conference, please note down your dietary requirements.  </p> 
<p> One conference dinner ticket is included with the cost of your registration. If you would like to purchase additional tickets for the conference dinner, you can do so during the registration.  </p>

<h1>Travel to the Conference Dinner</h1>
<p>The easiest way to get to the conference dinner is by public transport.  A paper ticket can be purchased at the fare machine at the UQ Lakes Bus Stop (see the annotated map below). 
  Bus 66 leaves from UQ Lakes Bus Stop D and takes about 20 minutes to get to Roma Street busway.  
  There is a 66 bus that leaves UQ Lakes at 5:30pm and we will have a conference volunteer taking that bus if you would like to join in as a group.
  On exiting Roma Street busway onto Roma street, you will see the Transcontinental Hotel almost immediately across the street (where Roma street and George street meet). 
  When you enter the Transcontinental Hotel, go up the staircase - the dinner will be held in a private function area on the upper level.) </p>

  <p>If you prefer a more scenic journey along the Brisbane river, you can take the City Cat ferry from the UQ St Lucia Ferry Terminal to the North Quay ferry terminal, Brisbane City.
  The travel time is about 23 minutes and then it's another 15-minute walk from the North Quary ferry terminal to the Transcontinental Hotel.  
    There is a City Cat leaving at 5:15 from the UQ terminal which will leave enough of time to get to the dinner by about 6pm. </p>
