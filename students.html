<h1>Student Support</h1>
<p>A limited amount of travel funding from the CMSA is available for students studying at an Australasian university, who attend the ACC and present a talk, 
  and who reside outside the capital city in which the ACC is being held. If you would like to apply for this support, please email <a href="melissa.lee@monash.edu">melissa.lee@monash.edu</a> with a letter of 
  support from your supervisor and an approximate budget of your expenses. All support obtained, or applied for, from all other sources must be listed or an explanation should be given as to why there is no other support available.
The deadline to submit is 4 October 2024. </p>

<h1>Student Prize</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://combinatorics-australasia.org/students.html"  target="_blank">CMSA Anne Penfold Street Student Prize</a> is awarded to the student who is judged to have given the best presentation at the ACC. 
  If you answer "Yes" to the "Are you a student?" question during registration, you will automatically be considered for the student prize.  
  If you are a student and you do not wish to be considered, or if you have any other questions about eligibility for the award, please email the organisers <a href="mailto:46acc@uq.edu.au">46acc@uq.edu.au</a> </p>
